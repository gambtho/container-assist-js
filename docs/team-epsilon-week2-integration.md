# Team Epsilon Week 2: Real Implementation Integration

## Status Update: Team Alpha & Beta Complete ✅

With Team Alpha (Core Infrastructure) and Team Beta (Sampling & Scoring) confirming completion of their Week 1-2 deliverables, Team Epsilon can now transition from mock-based development to real implementation integration.

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Team Alpha Integration (Current Priority)
**Components Available**:
- ✅ Resource Management with URI schemes and TTL caching
- ✅ Progress notification system with MCP compatibility
- ✅ Configuration management with validation
- ✅ Base orchestrator framework

**Integration Tasks**:
1. Replace mock ResourceManager with real implementation
2. Replace mock ProgressNotifier with MCP-compatible version
3. Update configuration handling to use real config system
4. Integrate with actual event emitter system

### Phase 2: Team Beta Integration (Next Priority)
**Components Available**:
- ✅ Dockerfile candidate generation with sampling
- ✅ Deterministic scoring algorithms
- ✅ K8s manifest sampling implementation
- ✅ Winner selection logic
- ✅ Candidate caching layer

**Integration Tasks**:
1. Replace mock sampling services with real implementations
2. Integrate with actual scoring algorithms
3. Connect to candidate caching system
4. Update workflow to use real sampling timeouts and configs

## Implementation Plan
