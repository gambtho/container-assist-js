# Team Gamma - MCP Inspector Testing Infrastructure

## Overview
This directory contains the comprehensive testing infrastructure for MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool validation, performance benchmarking, and integration testing.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:mcp

# Run only tool validation tests  
npm run test:mcp:tools

# Run in watch mode for development
npm run test:mcp:watch
```

### Manual MCP Inspector
```bash
# Interactive Inspector with real server
npm run mcp:inspect

# Interactive Inspector with mock server
npm run mcp:inspect:mock
```

## Framework Components

### Test Runner (`infrastructure/test-runner.ts`)
Core testing framework that:
- Connects to MCP server via SDK
- Manages test execution and reporting
- Provides performance metrics
- Supports parallel execution for load testing

### Test Suites (`suites/`)
- **tool-validation**: Basic tool functionality tests
- **resource-management**: Resource system validation (future)
- **sampling-validation**: Sampling algorithm tests (future)
- **integration-flows**: End-to-end workflows (future)
- **load-testing**: Concurrent operations (future)

## Current Test Coverage

### ✅ Working Tests
1. **ops-status-tool** - Ops tool status operation validation
2. **analyze-repository-basic** - Repository analysis with test fixture
3. **tool-response-time-validation** - Performance baseline validation

### ⚠️ Known Issues
1. **ops-ping-responds** - Response format needs adjustment for ping operation

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Tool Response Time | < 100ms | ~2ms ✅ |
| Memory per Operation | < 100KB | ~106KB ⚠️ |
| Repository Analysis | < 30s | ~4ms ✅ |

## Team Gamma Development Plan

### Week 1-2 ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] MCP Inspector environment setup
- [x] Basic test runner framework
- [x] Tool validation test suite
- [x] CI/CD npm scripts

### Week 3-4 (Next Steps)
- [ ] Sampling algorithm validation tests
- [ ] Resource management tests
- [ ] Enhanced performance benchmarking
- [ ] Edge case and error scenario coverage

### Week 5-6 (Future)
- [ ] End-to-end integration tests
- [ ] Load testing with concurrent operations
- [ ] Performance regression detection
- [ ] Complete documentation and training

## Adding New Tests

### 1. Create Test Function
```typescript
// test/mcp-inspector/suites/[category]/my-new-tests.ts
export const createMyTests = (testRunner: MCPTestRunner): TestCase[] => [
  {
    name: 'my-test-name',
    category: 'tool-validation',
    description: 'What this test validates',
    execute: async () => {
      const client = testRunner.getClient();
      const result = await client.callTool({
        name: 'tool-name',
        arguments: { /* ... */ }
      });
      
      return {
        success: !result.isError,
        duration: performance.now() - start,
        message: result.isError ? 'Error' : 'Success'
      };
    }
  }
];
```

### 2. Register Tests
```typescript
// test/mcp-inspector/runner.ts
import { createMyTests } from './suites/[category]/my-new-tests.js';

const myTests = createMyTests(testRunner);
myTests.forEach(test => testRunner.register(test));
```
