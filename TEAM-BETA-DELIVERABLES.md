- ✅ **DockerfileScorer** - Base scoring with 6 criteria
- ✅ **ProductionDockerfileScorer** - Security-weighted for production
- ✅ **DevelopmentDockerfileScorer** - Speed-weighted for development
- ✅ Scoring criteria:
  - Build Time (performance)
  - Image Size (efficiency)
  - Security (hardening practices)
  - Best Practices (Docker conventions)
  - Maintenance (readability, structure)
  - Performance (caching, optimization)

### 5. Main Orchestrator (`src/workflows/dockerfile-sampling.ts`)
- ✅ **DockerfileSamplingOrchestrator** - Main sampling coordinator
- ✅ **createDockerfileSampler** factory function
- ✅ Environment-specific scorer selection
- ✅ Custom weight support
- ✅ Validation and scoring utilities

### 6. Comprehensive Test Suite (`test/unit/sampling/`)
- ✅ **dockerfile-generator.test.ts** - 8 test scenarios
- ✅ **dockerfile-scorer.test.ts** - 6 test categories  
- ✅ **dockerfile-sampling.test.ts** - 7 integration scenarios
- ✅ Mock logger helper for consistent testing
- ✅ Deterministic behavior validation
- ✅ Error handling and edge case coverage

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### Multi-Candidate Generation
- Generates **3-5 different Dockerfile candidates** per request
- Each candidate uses a **different optimization strategy**
- **Deterministic generation** for consistent results
- **Progress tracking** via MCP protocol notifications

### Advanced Scoring System
- **6 scoring criteria** with configurable weights
- **Environment-specific scoring** (prod vs dev priorities)
- **Deterministic scoring** - same input = same scores
- **Detailed score breakdown** for transparency
- **0-100 point scale** with weighted final scores

### Caching & Performance
- **Hash-based caching** of generation results
- **TTL expiration** for cache management
- **Memory-efficient** candidate storage
- **Sub-30 second** generation time target

### Enterprise Ready
- **Result<T> pattern** for proper error handling
- **Structured logging** with pino integration
- **Configuration management** with sensible defaults
- **Type safety** throughout with TypeScript
- **Extensible architecture** for new strategies

## 📊 Sample Output

```javascript
// Example scoring result
{
  id: "alpine-multi-stage-a7c3f-1699123456",
  content: "FROM node:18-alpine AS builder\n...", 
  score: 92.5,
  rank: 1,
  scoreBreakdown: {
    buildTime: 85,    // 3 minutes = good
    imageSize: 95,    // 50MB = excellent  
    security: 90,     // Multi-stage + non-root user
    bestPractices: 88, // WORKDIR, COPY optimization
    maintenance: 92,  // Well commented + organized
    performance: 94   // Excellent caching + cleanup
  },
  metadata: {
    strategy: "alpine-multi-stage",
    confidence: 0.9,
    estimatedBuildTime: 180,
    estimatedSize: 50,
    securityRating: 9
  }
